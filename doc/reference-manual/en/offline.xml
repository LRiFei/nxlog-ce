     The nxlog-processor tool is similar to the nxlog daemon, it uses the same configuration file.
     The difference is that it runs in foreground and will exit if there are no more log messages
     available from the input sources. The input sources are typically file and database sources.
     This tool is useful for offline log processing tasks such as loading a bunch of files
     into a database, converting between different formats (e.g. CSV and syslog), testing
     patterns, doing offline event correlation or HMAC message integrity checking.
