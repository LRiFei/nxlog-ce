    Log messages sent to the om_null module instance are discarded, this module does not
    write its output anywhere.
    It can be useful for creating a dummy route, testing purposes. It can have 
    <link linkend="config_module_schedule">Scheduled</link> nxlog code execution as well
    like any other module,  so it is not completely useless.
    This module does not have any module specific configuration directives.
    See <link linkend="config_example_routes">this example</link> for usage.
