    This module does not generate any input, so basically it does nothing.
    Yet it can be useful for creating a dummy route, testing purposes, and it can have 
    <link linkend="config_module_schedule">Scheduled</link> nxlog code execution as well,
    so it is not completely useless.
    This module does not have any module specific configuration directives.
    See <link linkend="config_example_routes">this example</link> for usage.
