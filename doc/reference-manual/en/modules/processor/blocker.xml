  <title>Blocker (pm_blocker)</title>
  <para>
    This module can block log messages and can be used to simulate when a route is blocked.
    When the module blocks the data flow, log messages are first accumulated in the buffers,
    and then the flow-control mechanism pauses the input modules.
    Using the <link linkend="pm_blocker_proc_block">block()</link> procedure it is possibile
    to programatically stop or resume the data flow. It can be useful for real-world scenarios
    as well as testing. See the examples below.
    When the module starts, the blocking mode is disabled by default, i.e. it operate
    just like <link linkend="pm_null">pm_null</link> would.

      <para>
	In this example we collect messages received over UDP and forward it to another host
	via TCP. The log data is forwarded during non-working hours between 19 pm and 8 am.
	During the other half of the day data is buffered on the disk to be sent out only after
	19 pm.
